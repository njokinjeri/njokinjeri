# Hey, I'm Njoki Njeri 🐞

I'm a software developer interested in many things, but centrally: solving problems, even the small, minutiae ones.  
Like most unconventional epics, I first became fascinated by how simple web pages worked and felt a spark; it made me want to understand how everything behind the scenes comes together.

Turns out there's more, and I'm on a journey to unearth it by learning and building along the way.


## My Toolbox
**Learning:** TypeScript, Python  
**Building with:** JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Node.js, Express, React, SQL, PostgreSQL, Docker
